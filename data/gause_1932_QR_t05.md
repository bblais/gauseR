# The influence of temperature on the growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae

A dataset containing the abundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, grown in different temperatures (5.7 to 41 degrees C).
The Volume is measured in "Amount of yeast", which refers to a standardized index, based on the alcohol production per Unit of Yeast.


### A data frame with 102 rows and 7 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Table**: Table number in paper
- **Experiment**: Number of series: 1,2 or 3
- **Species**: Name of Species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
- **Time**: Hour of experiment
- **Volume**: "Amount of Yeast" of Species
- **Treatment**: Treatments: Temperatures (5.7 to 41 degrees C)

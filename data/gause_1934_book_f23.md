# Growth of Paramecium caudatum and Paramecium aurelia with wild bacteria  

A dataset containing the volume of Paramecium caudatum and 
Paramecium aurelia, grown in monoculture on buffered medium with two different 
wild bacteria concentrations ("one" and "half loop").
"Volume" refers to a standardized index, meant to make the abundances
of species comparable based on their relative sizes.

### A data frame with 61 rows and 6 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Species**: Name of Species: Paramecium caudatum and Paramecium aurelia
- **Time**: Day of experiment
- **Volume**: "Volume" of Species
- **Treatment**: Treatments: One Loop and Half Loop

# Raw data of Stylonychia pustulata in monoculture and mixture with and Paramecium aurelia and P. caudatum 

A dataset containing the abundances of Stylonychia pustulata grown in monoculture and mixture with P. aurelia 
and P. caudatum and the abundances of P. aurelia and P. caudautum in this mixtures on the medium of Osterhout. 
This dataset contains the raw data of three different experiments: Stylonychia pustulata grown in monoculture, in mixture with P.aurelia
and in mixture wit P.caudatum. The abundances of three to five cultures per experiment and the calculated mean abundances of the
experiments are reported. Note, that for day 20 - 25, single values are missing and only the mean is reported.

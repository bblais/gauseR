# Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with additional alcohol

A dataset containing the growth in volume of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultivated 
under anaerobic conditions with added alcohol.Gause measured the effect of alcohol on reaching
a saturated population. The saturation is measured in percent of the satured population grown without
additional alcohol. 

### A data frame with 6 rows and 5 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Species**: Name of Species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
- **Alcohol**: Additional alcohol in percent
- **Population**: Percentage of saturated population reached

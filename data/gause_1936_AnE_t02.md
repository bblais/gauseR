# Interaction  between  predators  (Cheyletus eruditus) and  prey  (Aleuroglyphus agilis)-Raw data

A dataset containing the abundance of Cheyletus eruditus and Aleuiroglyphus agilis,
as a predator-prey system on semoletta and wheat flour.  A fraction at the beginning of  
each experiment shows the initial  relation between predators and prey;  e.g. 10/5 means 10 prey 
and 5 predators (reported in variable "Treatment"). Dataset includes age structured population abundances.
The number of individuals is reported as Individuals per 0.2 g prey food. Wheat flour was used as food.

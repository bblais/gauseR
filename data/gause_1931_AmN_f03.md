# The influence of temperature on the asymptotic population of Moina macrocopa.

A dataset containing the population size of Moina macrocopa at the upper asymptote,
as a characteristic for the population beeing in equilibrium, under different temperatures.
Gause's goal was to determine the influence of ecological factors on population growth.


### A data frame with 3 rows and 5 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Species**: Name of Species: Tribolium confusum
- **Individuals**: Number of Individuals at population equlibrium
- **Treatment**: Treatments:20, 25 and 35 degrees Celcius

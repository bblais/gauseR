# Interaction between predators (Cheyletus eruditus) and prey (Aleuiroglyphus agilis) on millet, wheat flour and a mixture of these substances.

A dataset containing the abundance of Cheyletus eruditus and Aleuiroglyphus agilis,
as apredator-prey system under different food conditions for the prey (wheat and millet).
Gause's goal was to determine the influence of ecological factors on predator-prey dynamics.
The number of individuals is reported as Individuals per 0.2 g prey food.


### A data frame with 34 rows and 6 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Time**: Day of experiment
- **Species**: Name of Species: Cheyletus eruditus and Aleuiroglyphus agilis
- **Individuals**: Number of Individuals per 0.2 g
- **Treatment**: Treatments: Wheat, Millet, Wheat+Millet

# Growth of Paramecium caudatum and Paramecium aurelia in Mixture on Half Loop Medium 

A dataset containing the volume of Paramecium caudatum and 
Paramecium aurelia, grown in monoculture and in mixture on buffered medium with
low wild bacteria concentration ("half loop" medium).
"Volume" refers to a standardized index, meant to make the abundances
of species comparable based on their relative sizes.

### A data frame with 56 rows and 6 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Species**: Name of Species: Paramecium caudatum and Paramecium aurelia
- **Time**: Day of experiment
- **Volume**: "Volume" of Species
- **Treatment**: Treatments: Monoculture and Mixture

# The influence of quantity of food on the asymptotic population of Triboliurn confusum.

A dataset containing the population size of Tribolium confusum at the upper asymptote,
as a characteristic for the population beeing in equilibrium, under different quantities of food (flour).
Gause's goal was to determine the influence of ecological factors on population growth.


### A data frame with 4 rows and 5 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Species**: Name of Species: Tribolium confusum
- **Individuals**: Number of Individuals at population equlibrium
- **Treatment**: Treatments:16, 32, 64 and 128g flour per starting beetle pair

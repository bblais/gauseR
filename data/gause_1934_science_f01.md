# Didinium/Paramecium predator/prey experiment

A dataset containing the abundances of Paramecium caudatum
and Didinium nasutum grown in mixture. Note, is for the same experiment
as gause_1934_book_f32, except that data were digitized separately,
and therefore have small variations. These might be useful for
estimating observation error in the data digitization process.

### A data frame with 17 rows and 3 variables:

- **Paper**: Paper from which data are drawn
- **Figure**: Figure number in paper
- **Day**: Day of experiment
- **Prey**: Name of Prey Species
- **Individuals_Prey**: Number of Prey Individuals
- **Predator**: Name of Predator Species
- **Individuals_Predator**: Number of Predator Individuals
- **Immigration**: Is immigration occurring in this time-step? (yes or no)
